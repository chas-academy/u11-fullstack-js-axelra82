            <h2>
                We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it,
                and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to
                make the best decisions about the information that you share with us. That’s the
                basic purpose of this Privacy Policy.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Twitter is public and Tweets are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone
                around the world. We give you non-public ways to communicate on Twitter too, through
                protected Tweets and Direct Messages. You can also use Twitter under a pseudonym if
                you prefer not to use your name. When you use Twitter, even if you’re just looking
                at Tweets, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device
                you’re using and your IP address. You can choose to share additional information
                with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public
                profile. We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and
                showing you more relevant Tweets, people to follow, events, and ads.
            </p>
            <p>
                We give you control through your settings to limit the data we collect from you and
                how we use it, and to control things like account security, marketing preferences,
                apps that can access your account, and address book contacts you’ve uploaded to
                Twitter. You can also download information you have shared on Twitter. In addition
                to information you share with us, we use your Tweets, content you’ve read, Liked, or
                Retweeted, and other information to determine what topics you’re interested in, your
                age, the languages you speak, and other signals to show you more relevant content.
                We give you transparency into that information, and you can modify or correct it at
                any time.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have questions about this policy, how we collect or process your personal
                data, or anything else related to our privacy practices, we want to hear from you.
                You can contact us at any time.
            </p>
