-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

## Services

-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
    -   Firestore: document based realtime database
    -   Functions: cloud based functions, a.k.a. serverless
    -   Authentication: User management, a.k.a IAM

## Prerequisites

-   npm
    ```
    npm i -g npm@latest
    ```
-   firebase CLI. [Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
    ```
    npm i -g firebase-tools
    ```

## Getting started

After cloning the project (using [SSH](git@github.com:chas-academy/u11-fullstack-js-axelra82.git), [HTTPS](https://github.com/chas-academy/u11-fullstack-js-axelra82.git) or with GitHub CLI: `gh repo clone chas-academy/u11-fullstack-js-axelra82`) you will have to set up a firebase project and algolia search index online:

### firebase

-   Go to [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
-   Start a new project and name it what you want

Once your project is up and running you will have to create a web app. Click the **"+ Add app"** and then select **"Web"** (shown as **</>**). Choose what ever name you want for the app and select **"Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app"**. Then register the app.

You will now be presented with the suggestion of adding firebase SDK. Make note of the values and create a new file in your local project root folder called `.env.local`, this will contain your local environment variables. Use the following as a template and replace the `[YOUR-VALUE]` with the ones for your registered app:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_APP_ID=[YOUR-VALUE]
REACT_APP_WEB_API=https://us-central1-[REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/[CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME]
REACT_APP_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=[YOUR-ALGOLIA-APP-ID]
REACT_APP_ALGOLIA_API_KEY=[YOUR-ALGOLIA-API-SEARCH-KEY]
```

**NOTE** `CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME` will be the name you choose durring firebase cloud function initialization in the following steps. The Algolia key will be covered later on.

You will now need to initialize **"Firestore Database"** (which can also be done in the web console) and cloud functions (refered to as **Functions**).

To initialize functions on firebase you will need to go to **"Functions"** in the firebase console and activate it. This requires the **"Blaze"** plan, which is _pay-as-you-go_. As long as you don't have any faulty API calls going amok, you shouldn't have to worry.

_It is however advisable to set a spending limit alert when you activate this plan, that way you will be notified if it starts adding up. You will be suggested to set this up when activiating the Blaze plan. In the end you are always solely responsible for any charges that may occur!_

Visit [Initialize your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#initialize-your-project) firebase documentation for step-by-step instructions.

Once your project firestore database is activated you will need to create a root collection called `roles` with two documents (the id has to be named, i.e. do not use auto-id function):

1. `administrator`
2. `registered`

**Optional**

It is also recommended that you create a string field in each document called `description` with a short description of the roles.

**e.g**

**administrator**
_Admin users have CRUD access on all users, posts, mentions and messages_

**registered**
_Registered users have CRUD access on their own content and account_

**NOTE** To assign a user admin privileges change the `role` field in that user document to `roles/administrator`.

### Algolia

You will now need to set up a free account on [algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com) (If you want to know more about the pricing you can find that [here](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/)). This will act as your firebase search index and allow an instant search of the indexed collections from firebase. For this project we are only using the `users` collection as index.

**NOTE** _While the Algolia service is free, you are limited to 10k search requests/month. Keep in mind that the current way the "username search" works in the app is reactive, i.e. everytime you press a key in the searchbox it will query that index on algolia. SÃ¥ 10k searches can go by quickly if you do a lot of search-testing. In a real world environment, a "search" button would be more appropriate (or something else), to make sure that a index search is only performed on user request._

Once you're account is created you will need to set upp your index (indices). Name your index `instant_search`. Now you'll need to get the app ID and API keys. They can be found in the left menu in `API Keys`.

Update your two (2) `REACT_APP_ALGOLIA_` values `[YOUR-ALGOLIA-APP-ID]` with the `Application ID`, and `[YOUR-ALGOLIA-API-SEARCH-KEY]` with the `Search-Only API Key`.

Finally you will have to add the `Admin API Key` to your firebase functions config file using the firebase CLI. This adds them as environment variables in your firebase functions, which are used to sync adding, updating and deleting documents in firebase with your algolia indices. Replace placeholders with your own values.

Run `firebase functions:config:set algolia.appid="YOUR-ALGOLIA-APP-ID" algolia.apikey="YOUR-ALGOLIA-API-ADMIN-KEY"`

## Installation

Run `firebase deploy --only functions` to deploy your firebase cloud functions.

Run `npm i` from your project root folder to install all dependencies and then `npm run start` to initiate the project on localhost:3000

If everything looks good on the local environment you can do a build of the project and then run `firebase deploy --only hosting` to see it online from your firebase hosting.

## API

This project comes with an API powered by Node and express in the firebase functions. All cloud functions are located in the `functions` at the project root level.

### Routes

The root path is: https://us-central1-[REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/[YOUR-FUNCTION-NAME]
